# Personal-Projects
My personal projects in the fields of Electronics, Digital and Analogic Design and Software Programming
Hello girls and guys. This is where I list all my personal projects as a student. I hope you like them. Any feedback is appreciated.


Monopoly and Roenheld are two big C++ console applications, pieces of homework in my years of college, very based on Objected-Oriented Programming.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a C++ MDI application, done in C++ Builder app, from RadX Studio. It resembles the very popular minigame Tic-Tac-Toe, and can be downloaded and played by accessing the "Tic-Tac-Toe.exe" file from the "Release" directory. Two players are needed to play at the same PC (it's not a player vs computer game, or an online game). The interface is in Romanian language.

Project 1 is about building the design of a Wien Bridge Oscillator using a set of components values given by the college teachers, using Cadence OrCad. This process includes designing the circuit schematics, simulating and testing its functionality, and designing the PCB layout.
